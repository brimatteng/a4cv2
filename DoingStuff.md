To do:
===================================

- Make an Api

- Seed data
  - That's a thing

- Serializers
  - rabl/jbuilder/active model serializers? Which do we want to use?
  - I'm leaning towards jbuilder

- Securing an API

=====================================

- Versioning/Namespacing (Delayed until neccesary)
  - Subdomain api? (neccesary?) - probably not
  - What does subdomain do for file structure?
  - Dont version till neccesary!
  - Instead of putting the version into the url we can just use it as an    option on the headers and default it to the most recent version!
